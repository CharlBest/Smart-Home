## Considerations
* Fade/flush into decor, unobtrusive, helpful, not noticeable, one with the architecture and design
* Run locally not in the cloud. You own the data especially with video and audio
* All actions in UI/app should also be accessible via voice and/or traditional way
* Everything should be cordless and wireless charge via [Qi Wireless Charging Receiver Patches]().
* All consumables should be tracked like waste, electricity and water consumption conversely also track all generation like solar energy, wind energy and rainfall capture
* Paperless
* Rethink everything. Is it necessary?
