# The Ultimate Smart Home :gem:
### 180 ideas

## Intro
* This list is intended to show all the ideas for a smart home.
* It mainly consists of electrical items.
* It assumes that there is no house size limit and money constraints.
* Some of the items might be a bit opinionated.
* Reading through this list will sometimes make you feel like automating this or making it 'smart' is unnecessary, but this list is meant to showcase what can be done not what should be done.
* The example links are meant to steer you in the right direction and not necessarily the technology I recommend.
* Keep in mind I have no idea what I'm talking about.
* If you have any other ideas [click here to create an item that I will add later](https://github.com/CharlBest/Smart-Home/issues/new)

## Considerations
* Fade/flush into decor, unobtrusive, helpful, not noticeable, one with the architecture and design
* Run locally not in the cloud. You own the data especially with video and audio
* All actions in UI/app should also be accessible via voice and/or traditional way [Snips](https://docs.snips.ai/articles/platform/satellites)
* Everything should be cordless and wireless charge via [Qi Wireless Charging Receiver Patches]().
* All consumables should be tracked like waste, electricity and water consumption conversely also track all generation like solar energy, wind energy and rainfall capture
* Paperless
* Rethink everything. Is it necessary?
